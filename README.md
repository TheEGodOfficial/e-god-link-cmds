# E God's Linked Commands
Coolest command script thats FE to other script users!!!
The obfuscated part is basically a module to add you to an api database temporarily so it is FE to the people who are in that database and is using the script.
The obfuscated code is not malicious at all and will never be.
## Credits:
I think:
cat guy that goes by isteallivers/ieatlivers or whatever.
furry ca3r guy idk i forgot. (not sure if he worked on it with him but add him because whatever)
and me for funni uhhhh database thingy.
## Features
- tons of commands yeah
- uhhhhhh database thingy that removes you when you leave i guess
- people using the script can see commands being used yeah idk
- maybe based on an older version so some things may not work but who knows maybe the people who originally made it or whatever
- chat based yeah ok
- idk what else to put here
